def question10_2():
    answer: bool=True
    #justification:The correlation coefficient is a value between -1 and 1, representing the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two sets of real values.
    return answer

def question10_3():
    answer: bool=False
    #justification: Aggregation is typically preferred over simple sampling for reducing the size of a daily time series because it involves combining data over time intervals, preserving more information compared to simple random sampling.

def question10_4():
    answer: bool=False
    #justification:Noise and outliers are different; noise involves random variations, while outliers are distinct data points that deviate significantly from the majority, potentially indicating anomalies or errors.

def question10_5():
    answer: bool= False
    #justification: Outliers are not always noise; they can convey important information or indicate anomalies in the data.

def question10_6():
    answer: bool=False
    #justification: A binary attribute with values 0 or 1 is symmetric, not asymmetric, as both values are equally meaningful.
    return answer

def question10_7():
    answer: bool= False
    #justification: A cosine measure of 1 for vectors of counts indicates perfect alignment but not necessarily identical objects, as magnitudes can differ while maintaining perfect alignment.
    return answer

def question10_8():
    answer: bool= False
    #justification: Discrete variables can be ratio variables if they have a true zero point, where zero represents the absence of the quantity being measured.
    return answer

def question10_9():
    answer: bool= False
    #justification: Quantitative variables can be either discrete (distinct values) or continuous (any value within a range)
    return answer

def question10_10():
    answer: bool= False
    #justification:  Converting ordinal to asymmetric binary may lose information, as it simplifies the ordinal relationship into binary, ignoring the original order and distinctions between levels.
